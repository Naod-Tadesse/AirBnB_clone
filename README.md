# AirBnB Clone - The Console

## Project Overview

Welcome to the AirBnB clone project! This first phase is dedicated to crafting a powerful command-line interface (CLI) designed to manage core AirBnB objects such as Users, Places, States, Cities, and more. As you delve into this journey, you'll be architecting foundational classes, harnessing a sophisticated file-based storage system, and implementing rigorous testing practices.

## Key Concepts and Technologies

- Python packages and modules
- Command-line interpreters using the cmd module
- Unit testing with the unittest module
- Object serialization and deserialization (JSON)
- Datetime management
- UUID generation
- Argument parsing

## Getting Started

1. **Install Python 3.8.5:** Ensure the correct Python version is installed.
2. **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/AirBnB_clone/AirBnB_clone.git`
3. **Navigate to the project directory:** `cd AirBnB_clone`

## Running the Console

- Execute the console: `./console.py`
- Type `help` for a comprehensive list of available commands.

## Key Features

- Create, retrieve, update, and delete AirBnB objects
- Persistent storage of objects in JSON files
- Comprehensive unit tests to ensure robust functionality

## File Structure

- `models/`: Home to model classes (BaseModel, User, Place, etc.)
- `models/engine/`: Hosts the FileStorage class for object persistence
- `tests/`: Comprises unit tests for all model classes
- `console.py`: The epicenter of the command-line interface
- `README.md`: Your current reading material
